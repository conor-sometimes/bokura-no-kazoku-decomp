# Lessons: Bokura no Kazoku

Things that took more than a few minutes to figure out on this project. Add to it as you go.
Cross-project lessons (other decomps, the method) also go to the `decomp` skill's lessons file.

## 2026-10-13: Nix environments, PS2 round-trip, tooling (Lombyte + Bokura + Crash Bash)

- **PS2 ELF round-trip with splat** (Bokura, done in under 10 minutes): use `splat64[mips]`
  (plain `splat64` can't import n64img); set `ld_align_section_vram_end: False` and
  `ld_align_segment_vram_end: False` (default ALIGN(64) padding breaks the layout); turn raw
  bins (VU microcode) into objects with `.incbin` through the same assembler, not
  `objcopy -I binary` (32/64-bit mismatch at link); rebuild the ELF container from a table of the
  retail section headers (stripped files keep odd entries: .shstrtab still names .symtab, .bss
  offsets that don't follow addresses, .DVP.ovlytab type 0x7FFFF420). *(bokura)*
- **spimdisasm vs Ghidra** for function discovery on a stripped PS2 ELF: spimdisasm 7228, Ghidra
  5911, only 7 of Ghidra's missing from spimdisasm. Ghidra is for understanding and naming; it
  isn't needed for the round-trip. *(bokura)*

## 2026-10-13: Bokura (PS2, EE-GCC 2.96 C++)

- **EE-GCC 2.96 sibling calls in C++ only for value-returning tail calls**: `void f(){ g(); }` keeps
  `jal` + `jr $ra`; `int f(){ return g(); }` becomes "frame kept, `ld $ra`, `j g`". So a retail
  `j callee` after a dead `sd/ld $ra` tells you the caller returns the callee's value (C compiles
  both as sibcalls). *(bokura)*
- **Translation units from vtable order**: GCC 2.x emits each unit's vtables into its .data in link
  order and in reverse class order within a unit; key each vtable by its lowest referencing function,
  start a unit at each new high-water mark, and name it from RTTI (vtable word 1 = typeinfo function,
  which loads the mangled name into `$a1`). 192 vtables gave 127 units, agreeing with .rodata order at
  all but three boundaries; inline-header `__FILE__` strings (`../dklib/include/state.h`) duplicated per
  unit confirm them and reveal units hidden inside one (scripts/find_units.py). *(bokura)*
- **Mixed C++/INCLUDE_ASM objects on EE-GCC 2.96**: assemble with the compiler's own GNU as 2.10-ee
  (modern gas encodes `move` as `or` and adds COP1 hazard nops). It only knows numeric registers, so
  set splat `named_regs_for_c_funcs: False`; it rejects spimdisasm's VU0 macro mnemonics (`vmulaw`...).
  Its `.L` labels made `.global` still link jump tables fine. *(bokura)*
- **`$v1` instead of `$v0` for a lone `lui` in a setter** = the function is non-void without a
  return statement (v0 is live at exit). *(bokura)*
- **GCC 2.96 has no empty-base optimisation**: an empty base class takes 1 byte and shifts the
  derived class's fields (saw `addiu a0, a0, 33` for a member at 0x20). Give the base its real size. *(bokura)*
- **Don't declare classes `virtual` in a partially split unit**: the first non-inline virtual
  defined in the unit makes GCC emit the vtable/typeinfo into the object's .data/.rodata and breaks
  the layout. Leave vptr-storing constructors and virtual calls until the unit's data is split. *(bokura)*
- **Store order of field clears is not source order**: brute-force permutations of the statements
  (tools/bk `perm`); natural order matched about half the time. *(bokura)*
